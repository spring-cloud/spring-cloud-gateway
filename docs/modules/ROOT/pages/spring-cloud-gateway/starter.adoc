= How to Include Spring Cloud Gateway
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

To include Spring Cloud Gateway in your project, use the starter with a group ID of `org.springframework.cloud` and an artifact ID of `spring-cloud-starter-gateway`.
See the https://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/[Spring Cloud Project page] for details on setting up your build system with the current Spring Cloud Release Train.

If you include the starter, but you do not want the gateway to be enabled, set `spring.cloud.gateway.enabled=false`.

IMPORTANT: Spring Cloud Gateway is built on https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot#learn[Spring Boot], https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html[Spring WebFlux], and https://projectreactor.io/docs[Project Reactor].
As a consequence, many of the familiar synchronous libraries (Spring Data and Spring Security, for example) and patterns you know may not apply when you use Spring Cloud Gateway.
If you are unfamiliar with these projects, we suggest you begin by reading their documentation to familiarize yourself with some new concepts before working with Spring Cloud Gateway.

IMPORTANT: Spring Cloud Gateway requires the Netty runtime provided by Spring Boot and Spring Webflux.
It does not work in a traditional Servlet Container or when built as a WAR.
