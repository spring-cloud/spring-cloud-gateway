This section covers common problems that may arise when you use Spring Cloud Gateway.

[[log-levels]]
== Log Levels

The following loggers may contain valuable troubleshooting information at the `DEBUG` and `TRACE` levels:

- `org.springframework.cloud.gateway`
- `org.springframework.http.server.reactive`
- `org.springframework.web.reactive`
- `org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.web`
- `reactor.netty`
- `redisratelimiter`

[[wiretap]]
== Wiretap

The Reactor Netty `HttpClient` and `HttpServer` can have wiretap enabled.
When combined with setting the `reactor.netty` log level to `DEBUG` or `TRACE`, it enables the logging of information, such as headers and bodies sent and received across the wire.
To enable wiretap, set `spring.cloud.gateway.httpserver.wiretap=true` or `spring.cloud.gateway.httpclient.wiretap=true` for the `HttpServer` and `HttpClient`, respectively.
