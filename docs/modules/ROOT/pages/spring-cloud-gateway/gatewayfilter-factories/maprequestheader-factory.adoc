= `MapRequestHeader` `GatewayFilter` Factory

The `MapRequestHeader` `GatewayFilter` factory takes `fromHeader` and `toHeader` parameters.
It creates a new named header (`toHeader`), and the value is extracted out of an existing named header (`fromHeader`) from the incoming http request.
If the input header does not exist, the filter has no impact.
If the new named header already exists, its values are augmented with the new values.
The following example configures a `MapRequestHeader`:

.application.yml
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
      - id: map_request_header_route
        uri: https://example.org
        filters:
        - MapRequestHeader=Blue, X-Request-Red
----

This adds the `X-Request-Red:<values>` header to the downstream request with updated values from the incoming HTTP request's `Blue` header.
