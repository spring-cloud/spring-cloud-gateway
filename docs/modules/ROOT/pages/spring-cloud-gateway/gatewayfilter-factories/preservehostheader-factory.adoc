= `PreserveHostHeader` `GatewayFilter` Factory
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

The `PreserveHostHeader` `GatewayFilter` factory has no parameters.
This filter sets a request attribute that the routing filter inspects to determine if the original host header should be sent rather than the host header determined by the HTTP client.
The following example configures a `PreserveHostHeader` `GatewayFilter`:

.application.yml
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
      - id: preserve_host_route
        uri: https://example.org
        filters:
        - PreserveHostHeader
