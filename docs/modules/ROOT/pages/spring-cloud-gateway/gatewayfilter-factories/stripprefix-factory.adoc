= `StripPrefix` `GatewayFilter` Factory

The `StripPrefix` `GatewayFilter` factory takes one parameter, `parts`.
The `parts` parameter indicates the number of parts in the path to strip from the request before sending it downstream.
The following listing configures a `StripPrefix` `GatewayFilter`:

.application.yml
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
      - id: nameRoot
        uri: https://nameservice
        predicates:
        - Path=/name/**
        filters:
        - StripPrefix=2
----

When a request is made through the gateway to `/name/blue/red`, the request made to `nameservice` looks like `https://nameservice/red`.
