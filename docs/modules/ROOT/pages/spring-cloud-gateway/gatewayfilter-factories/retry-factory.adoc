= `Retry` `GatewayFilter` Factory

The `Retry` `GatewayFilter` factory supports the following parameters:

* `retries`: The number of retries that should be attempted.
* `statuses`: The HTTP status codes that should be retried, represented by using `org.springframework.http.HttpStatus`.
* `methods`: The HTTP methods that should be retried, represented by using `org.springframework.http.HttpMethod`.
* `series`: The series of status codes to be retried, represented by using `org.springframework.http.HttpStatus.Series`.
* `exceptions`: A list of thrown exceptions that should be retried.
* `backoff`: The configured exponential backoff for the retries.
Retries are performed after a backoff interval of `firstBackoff * (factor ^ n)`, where `n` is the iteration.
If `maxBackoff` is configured, the maximum backoff applied is limited to `maxBackoff`.
If `basedOnPreviousValue` is true, the backoff is calculated by using `prevBackoff * factor`.

The following defaults are configured for `Retry` filter, if enabled:

* `retries`: Three times
* `series`: 5XX series
* `methods`: GET method
* `exceptions`: `IOException` and `TimeoutException`
* `backoff`: disabled

The following listing configures a Retry `GatewayFilter`:

NOTE: When using the retry filter with a `forward:` prefixed URL, the target endpoint should be written carefully so that, in case of an error, it does not do anything that could result in a response being sent to the client and committed.
For example, if the target endpoint is an annotated controller, the target controller method should not return `ResponseEntity` with an error status code.
Instead, it should throw an `Exception` or signal an error (for example, through a `Mono.error(ex)` return value), which the retry filter can be configured to handle by retrying.

WARNING: When using the retry filter with any HTTP method with a body, the body will be cached and the gateway will become memory constrained. The body is cached in a request attribute defined by `ServerWebExchangeUtils.CACHED_REQUEST_BODY_ATTR`. The type of the object is `org.springframework.core.io.buffer.DataBuffer`.

A simplified "shortcut" notation can be added with a single `status` and `method`.

The following two examples are equivalent:
