= `RemoveResponseHeader` `GatewayFilter` Factory

The `RemoveResponseHeader` `GatewayFilter` factory takes a `name` parameter.
It is the name of the header to be removed.
The following listing configures a `RemoveResponseHeader` `GatewayFilter`:

.application.yml
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
      - id: removeresponseheader_route
        uri: https://example.org
        filters:
        - RemoveResponseHeader=X-Response-Foo
----

This will remove the `X-Response-Foo` header from the response before it is returned to the gateway client.

To remove any kind of sensitive header, you should configure this filter for any routes for which you may want to do so.
In addition, you can configure this filter once by using `spring.cloud.gateway.default-filters` and have it applied to all routes.
