= `SetPath` `GatewayFilter` Factory

The `SetPath` `GatewayFilter` factory takes a path `template` parameter.
It offers a simple way to manipulate the request path by allowing templated segments of the path.
This uses the URI templates from Spring Framework.
Multiple matching segments are allowed.
The following example configures a `SetPath` `GatewayFilter`:

.application.yml
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
      - id: setpath_route
        uri: https://example.org
        predicates:
        - Path=/red/{segment}
        filters:
        - SetPath=/{segment}
----

For a request path of `/red/blue`, this sets the path to `/blue` before making the downstream request.
