= `PrefixPath` `GatewayFilter` Factory
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

The `PrefixPath` `GatewayFilter` factory takes a single `prefix` parameter.
The following example configures a `PrefixPath` `GatewayFilter`:

.application.yml
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
      - id: prefixpath_route
        uri: https://example.org
        filters:
        - PrefixPath=/mypath
----

This prefixes `/mypath` to the path of all matching requests.
So a request to `/hello` is sent to `/mypath/hello`.
