[[local-cache-response-filter]]
= `LocalResponseCache` `GatewayFilter` Factory

This filter allows caching the response body and headers to follow these rules:

* It can only cache bodiless GET requests.
* It caches the response only for one of the following status codes: HTTP 200 (OK), HTTP 206 (Partial Content), or HTTP 301 (Moved Permanently).
* Response data is not cached if `Cache-Control` header does not allow it (`no-store` present in the request or `no-store` or `private` present in the response).
* If the response is already cached and a new request is performed with no-cache value in `Cache-Control` header, it returns a bodiless response with 304 (Not Modified).

This filter configures the local response cache per route and is available only if the `spring.cloud.gateway.filter.local-response-cache.enabled` property is enabled. And a xref:spring-cloud-gateway/global-filters.adoc#local-cache-response-global-filter[local response cache configured globally] is also available as feature.

It accepts the first parameter to override the time to expire a cache entry (expressed in `s` for seconds, `m` for minutes, and `h` for hours) and a second parameter to set the maximum size of the cache to evict entries for this route (`KB`, `MB`, or `GB`).

The following listing shows how to add local response cache `GatewayFilter`:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
public RouteLocator routes(RouteLocatorBuilder builder) {
    return builder.routes()
        .route("rewrite_response_upper", r -> r.host("*.rewriteresponseupper.org")
            .filters(f -> f.prefixPath("/httpbin")
        		.localResponseCache(Duration.ofMinutes(30), "500MB")
            ).uri(uri))
        .build();
}
----

or this

.application.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
      - id: resource
        uri: http://localhost:9000
        predicates:
        - Path=/resource
        filters:
        - LocalResponseCache=30m,500MB
----

NOTE: This filter also automatically calculates the `max-age` value in the HTTP `Cache-Control` header.
Only if `max-age` is present on the original response is the value rewritten with the number of seconds set in the `timeToLive` configuration parameter.
In consecutive calls, this value is recalculated with the number of seconds left until the response expires.

NOTE: To enable this feature, add `com.github.ben-manes.caffeine:caffeine` and `spring-boot-starter-cache` as project dependencies.

WARNING: If your project creates custom `CacheManager` beans, it will either need to be marked with `@Primary` or injected using `@Qualifier`.
