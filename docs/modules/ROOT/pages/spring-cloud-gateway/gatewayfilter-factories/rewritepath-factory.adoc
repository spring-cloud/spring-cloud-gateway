= `RewritePath` `GatewayFilter` Factory

The `RewritePath` `GatewayFilter` factory takes a path `regexp` parameter and a `replacement` parameter.
This uses Java regular expressions for a flexible way to rewrite the request path.
The following listing configures a `RewritePath` `GatewayFilter`:

.application.yml
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
      - id: rewritepath_route
        uri: https://example.org
        predicates:
        - Path=/red/**
        filters:
        - RewritePath=/red/?(?<segment>.*), /$\{segment}
----

For a request path of `/red/blue`, this sets the path to `/blue` before making the downstream request. Note that the `$` should be replaced with `$\` because of the YAML specification.
