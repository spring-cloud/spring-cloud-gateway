[[actuator-api]]
= Actuator API

The `/gateway` actuator endpoint lets you monitor and interact with a Spring Cloud Gateway application.
To be remotely accessible, the endpoint has to be https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-endpoints.html#production-ready-endpoints-enabling-endpoints[enabled] and https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-endpoints.html#production-ready-endpoints-exposing-endpoints[exposed over HTTP or JMX] in the application properties.
The following listing shows how to do so:

.application.properties
[source,properties]
----
management.endpoint.gateway.enabled=true # default value
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=gateway
----

This endpoint provides an overview of what is available on the child actuator endpoint and the available methods for each reference. The resulting response is similar to the following:

[source,json]
----
[
   {
      "href":"/actuator/gateway/",
      "methods":[ "GET" ]
   },
   {
      "href":"/actuator/gateway/routedefinitions",
      "methods":[ "GET" ]
   },
   {
      "href":"/actuator/gateway/globalfilters",
      "methods":[ "GET" ]
   },
   {
      "href":"/actuator/gateway/routefilters",
      "methods":[ "GET" ]
   },
   {
      "href":"/actuator/gateway/routes",
      "methods":[ "POST", "GET" ]
   },
   {
      "href":"/actuator/gateway/routepredicates",
      "methods":[ "GET" ]
   },
   {
      "href":"/actuator/gateway/refresh",
      "methods":[ "POST" ]
   },
   {
      "href":"/actuator/gateway/routes/route-id-1/combinedfilters",
      "methods":[ "GET" ]
   },
   {
      "href":"/actuator/gateway/routes/route-id-1",
      "methods":[ "POST", "DELETE", "GET" ]
   }
]
----

[[verbose-actuator-format]]
== Verbose Actuator Format

A new, more verbose format has been added to Spring Cloud Gateway.
It adds more detail to each route, letting you view the predicates and filters associated with each route along with any configuration that is available.
The following example configures `/actuator/gateway/routes`:

[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "predicate": "(Hosts: [**.addrequestheader.org] && Paths: [/headers], match trailing slash: true)",
    "route_id": "add_request_header_test",
    "filters": [
      "[[AddResponseHeader X-Response-Default-Foo = 'Default-Bar'], order = 1]",
      "[[AddRequestHeader X-Request-Foo = 'Bar'], order = 1]",
      "[[PrefixPath prefix = '/httpbin'], order = 2]"
    ],
    "uri": "lb://testservice",
    "order": 0
  }
]
----

This feature is enabled by default. To disable it, set the following property:

.application.properties
[source,properties]
----
spring.cloud.gateway.actuator.verbose.enabled=false
----

This will default to `true` in a future release.

[[retrieving-route-filters]]
== Retrieving Route Filters

This section details how to retrieve route filters, including:

* xref:spring-cloud-gateway/actuator-api.adoc#gateway-global-filters[Global Filters]
* <<gateway-route-filters>>

[[gateway-global-filters]]
=== Global Filters

To retrieve the xref:spring-cloud-gateway/global-filters.adoc[global filters] applied to all routes, make a `GET` request to `/actuator/gateway/globalfilters`. The resulting response is similar to the following:

----
{
  "org.springframework.cloud.gateway.filter.ReactiveLoadBalancerClientFilter@77856cc5": 10100,
  "org.springframework.cloud.gateway.filter.RouteToRequestUrlFilter@4f6fd101": 10000,
  "org.springframework.cloud.gateway.filter.NettyWriteResponseFilter@32d22650": -1,
  "org.springframework.cloud.gateway.filter.ForwardRoutingFilter@106459d9": 2147483647,
  "org.springframework.cloud.gateway.filter.NettyRoutingFilter@1fbd5e0": 2147483647,
  "org.springframework.cloud.gateway.filter.ForwardPathFilter@33a71d23": 0,
  "org.springframework.cloud.gateway.filter.AdaptCachedBodyGlobalFilter@135064ea": 2147483637,
  "org.springframework.cloud.gateway.filter.WebsocketRoutingFilter@23c05889": 2147483646
}
----

The response contains the details of the global filters that are in place.
For each global filter, there is a string representation of the filter object (for example, `org.springframework.cloud.gateway.filter.ReactiveLoadBalancerClientFilter@77856cc5`) and the corresponding xref:spring-cloud-gateway/global-filters.adoc#gateway-combined-global-filter-and-gatewayfilter-ordering[order] in the filter chain.

[[gateway-route-filters]]
=== Route Filters
To retrieve the xref:spring-cloud-gateway/gatewayfilter-factories.adoc[`GatewayFilter` factories] applied to routes, make a `GET` request to `/actuator/gateway/routefilters`.
The resulting response is similar to the following:

----
{
  "[AddRequestHeaderGatewayFilterFactory@570ed9c configClass = AbstractNameValueGatewayFilterFactory.NameValueConfig]": null,
  "[SecureHeadersGatewayFilterFactory@fceab5d configClass = Object]": null,
  "[SaveSessionGatewayFilterFactory@4449b273 configClass = Object]": null
}
----

The response contains the details of the `GatewayFilter` factories applied to any particular route.
For each factory there is a string representation of the corresponding object (for example, `[SecureHeadersGatewayFilterFactory@fceab5d configClass = Object]`).
Note that the `null` value is due to an incomplete implementation of the endpoint controller, because it tries to set the order of the object in the filter chain, which does not apply to a `GatewayFilter` factory object.

[[refreshing-the-route-cache]]
== Refreshing the Route Cache

To clear the routes cache, make a `POST` request to `/actuator/gateway/refresh`.
The request returns a 200 without a response body.

To clear the routes with specific metadata values, add the Query parameter `metadata` specifying the `key:value` pairs that the routes to be cleared should match.
If an error is produced during the asynchronous refresh, the refresh will not modify the existing routes.

Sending `POST` request to `/actuator/gateway/refresh?metadata=group:group-1` will only refresh the routes whose `group` metadata is `group-1`: `first_route` and `third_route`.
[source,json]
----
[{
  "route_id": "first_route",
  "route_object": {
    "predicate": "...",
  },
  "metadata": { "group": "group-1" }
},
{
  "route_id": "second_route",
  "route_object": {
    "predicate": "...",
  },
  "metadata": { "group": "group-2" }
},
{
  "route_id": "third_route",
  "route_object": {
    "predicate": "...",
  },
  "metadata": { "group": "group-1" }
}]
----

[[retrieving-the-routes-defined-in-the-gateway]]
== Retrieving the Routes Defined in the Gateway

To retrieve the routes defined in the gateway, make a `GET` request to `/actuator/gateway/routes`.
The resulting response is similar to the following:

----
[{
  "route_id": "first_route",
  "route_object": {
    "predicate": "org.springframework.cloud.gateway.handler.predicate.PathRoutePredicateFactory$$Lambda$432/1736826640@1e9d7e7d",
    "filters": [
      "OrderedGatewayFilter{delegate=org.springframework.cloud.gateway.filter.factory.PreserveHostHeaderGatewayFilterFactory$$Lambda$436/674480275@6631ef72, order=0}"
    ]
  },
  "order": 0
},
{
  "route_id": "second_route",
  "route_object": {
    "predicate": "org.springframework.cloud.gateway.handler.predicate.PathRoutePredicateFactory$$Lambda$432/1736826640@cd8d298",
    "filters": []
  },
  "order": 0
}]
----

The response contains the details of all the routes defined in the gateway.
The following table describes the structure of each element (each is a route) of the response:

[cols="3,2,4"]
|===
| Path | Type | Description

|`route_id`

[[gateway-retrieving-information-about-a-particular-route]]
== Retrieving Information about a Particular Route

To retrieve information about a single route, make a `GET` request to `/actuator/gateway/routes/\{id}` (for example, `/actuator/gateway/routes/first_route`).
The resulting response is similar to the following:

----
{
  "id": "first_route",
  "predicates": [{
    "name": "Path",
    "args": {"_genkey_0":"/first"}
  }],
  "filters": [],
  "uri": "https://www.uri-destination.org",
  "order": 0
}
----

The following table describes the structure of the response:

[cols="3,2,4"]
|===
| Path | Type | Description

|`id`
| String
| The route ID.

|`predicates`
| Array
| The collection of route predicates. Each item defines the name and the arguments of a given predicate.

|`filters`
| Array
| The collection of filters applied to the route.

|`uri`
| String
| The destination URI of the route.

|`order`
| Number
| The route order.

|===

[[creating-and-deleting-a-particular-route-definition]]
== Creating and Deleting a Particular Route Definition

To create a route definition, make a `POST` request to `/gateway/routes/\{id_route_to_create}` with a JSON body that specifies the fields of the route (see xref:spring-cloud-gateway/actuator-api.adoc#gateway-retrieving-information-about-a-particular-route[Retrieving Information about a Particular Route]).

To delete a route definition, make a `DELETE` request to `/gateway/routes/\{id_route_to_delete}`.

[[creating-multiple-route-definitions]]
== Creating multiple Route Definitions

To create multiple route definitions in a single request, make a `POST` request to `/gateway/routes` with a JSON body that specifies the fields of the route, including the route id (see xref:spring-cloud-gateway/actuator-api.adoc#gateway-retrieving-information-about-a-particular-route[Retrieving Information about a Particular Route]).

The route definitions will be discarded if any route raises an error during the creation of the routes.

[[recap:-the-list-of-all-endpoints]]
