[[global-filters]]
= Global Filters

The `GlobalFilter` interface has the same signature as `GatewayFilter`.
These are special filters that are conditionally applied to all routes.

NOTE: This interface and its usage are subject to change in future milestone releases.

[[gateway-combined-global-filter-and-gatewayfilter-ordering]]
== Combined Global Filter and `GatewayFilter` Ordering

When a request matches a route, the filtering web handler adds all instances of `GlobalFilter` and all route-specific instances of `GatewayFilter` to a filter chain.
This combined filter chain is sorted by the `org.springframework.core.Ordered` interface, which you can set by implementing the `getOrder()` method.

As Spring Cloud Gateway distinguishes between "`pre`" and "`post`" phases for filter logic execution (see xref:spring-cloud-gateway/how-it-works.adoc[How it Works]), the filter with the highest precedence is the first in the "`pre`"-phase and the last in the "`post`"-phase.

The following listing configures a filter chain:

.ExampleConfiguration.java
[source,java]
----
@Bean
public GlobalFilter customFilter() {
    return new CustomGlobalFilter();
}

public class CustomGlobalFilter implements GlobalFilter, Ordered {

    @Override
    public Mono<Void> filter(ServerWebExchange exchange, GatewayFilterChain chain) {
        log.info("custom global filter");
        return chain.filter(exchange);
    }

    @Override
    public int getOrder() {
        return -1;
    }
}

[[gateway-metrics-filter]]
== The Gateway Metrics Filter

To enable gateway metrics, add `spring-boot-starter-actuator` as a project dependency. Then, by default, the gateway metrics filter runs as long as the `spring.cloud.gateway.metrics.enabled` property is not set to `false`.
This filter adds a timer metric named `spring.cloud.gateway.requests` with the following tags:

* `routeId`: The route ID.
* `routeUri`: The URI to which the API is routed.
* `outcome`: The outcome, as classified by link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/http/HttpStatus.Series.html[HttpStatus.Series].
* `status`: The HTTP status of the request returned to the client.
* `httpStatusCode`: The HTTP Status of the request returned to the client.
* `httpMethod`: The HTTP method used for the request.

In addition, through the `spring.cloud.gateway.metrics.tags.path.enabled` property (by default, `false`), you can activate an extra metric with the path tag:

* `path`: The path of the request.

These metrics are then available to be scraped from `/actuator/metrics/spring.cloud.gateway.requests` and can be easily integrated with Prometheus to create a link:images/gateway-grafana-dashboard.jpeg[Grafana] link:gateway-grafana-dashboard.json[dashboard].

NOTE: To enable the prometheus endpoint, add `micrometer-registry-prometheus` as a project dependency.

[[local-cache-response-global-filter]]
== The Local Response Cache Filter

The `LocalResponseCache` runs if associated properties are enabled:

* `spring.cloud.gateway.global-filter.local-response-cache.enabled`: Activates the global cache for all routes
* `spring.cloud.gateway.filter.local-response-cache.enabled`: Activates the associated filter to use at route level

This feature enables a local cache using Caffeine for all responses that meet the following criteria:

* The request is a bodiless GET.
* The response has one of the following status codes: HTTP 200 (OK), HTTP 206 (Partial Content), or HTTP 301 (Moved Permanently).
* The HTTP `Cache-Control` header allows caching (that means it does not have any of the following values: `no-store` present in the request and `no-store` or `private` present in the response).

It accepts two configuration parameters:

* `spring.cloud.gateway.filter.local-response-cache.size`: Sets the maximum size of the cache to evict entries for this route (in KB, MB and GB).
* `spring.cloud.gateway.filter.local-response-cache.time-to-live` Sets the time to expire a cache entry (expressed in s for seconds, m for minutes, and h for hours).

If none of these parameters are configured but the global filter is enabled, by default, it configures 5 minutes of time to live for the cached response.

This filter also implements the automatic calculation of the `max-age` value in the HTTP `Cache-Control` header.
If `max-age` is present on the original response, the value is rewritten with the number of seconds set in the `timeToLive` configuration parameter.
In subsequent calls, this value is recalculated with the number of seconds left until the response expires.

Setting `spring.cloud.gateway.global-filter.local-response-cache.enabled` to `false` deactivate the local response cache for all routes, the xref:spring-cloud-gateway/gatewayfilter-factories/local-cache-response-filter.adoc[LocalResponseCache filter] allows to use this functionality at route level.

NOTE: To enable this feature, add `com.github.ben-manes.caffeine:caffeine` and `spring-boot-starter-cache` as project dependencies.

WARNING: If your project creates custom `CacheManager` beans, it will either need to be marked with `@Primary` or injected using `@Qualifier`.

[[forward-routing-filter]]
== Forward Routing Filter

The `ForwardRoutingFilter` looks for a URI in the exchange attribute `ServerWebExchangeUtils.GATEWAY_REQUEST_URL_ATTR`.
If the URL has a `forward` scheme (such as `forward:///localendpoint`), it uses the Spring `DispatcherHandler` to handle the request.
The path part of the request URL is overridden with the path in the forward URL.
The unmodified original URL is appended to the list in the `ServerWebExchangeUtils.GATEWAY_ORIGINAL_REQUEST_URL_ATTR` attribute.

[[netty-routing-filter]]
== The Netty Routing Filter

The Netty routing filter runs if the URL located in the `ServerWebExchangeUtils.GATEWAY_REQUEST_URL_ATTR` exchange attribute has a `http` or `https` scheme.
It uses the Netty `HttpClient` to make the downstream proxy request.
The response is put in the `ServerWebExchangeUtils.CLIENT_RESPONSE_ATTR` exchange attribute for use in a later filter.
(There is also an experimental `WebClientHttpRoutingFilter` that performs the same function but does not require Netty.)

[[netty-write-response-filter]]
== The Netty Write Response Filter

The `NettyWriteResponseFilter` runs if there is a Netty `HttpClientResponse` in the `ServerWebExchangeUtils.CLIENT_RESPONSE_ATTR` exchange attribute.
It runs after all other filters have completed and writes the proxy response back to the gateway client response.
(There is also an experimental `WebClientWriteResponseFilter` that performs the same function but does not require Netty.)

[[reactive-loadbalancer-client-filter]]
== `ReactiveLoadBalancerClientFilter`

The `ReactiveLoadBalancerClientFilter` looks for a URI in the exchange attribute named `ServerWebExchangeUtils.GATEWAY_REQUEST_URL_ATTR`.
If the URL has a `lb` scheme (such as `lb://myservice`), it uses the Spring Cloud `ReactorLoadBalancer` to resolve the name (`myservice` in this example) to an actual host and port and replaces the URI in the same attribute.
The unmodified original URL is appended to the list in the `ServerWebExchangeUtils.GATEWAY_ORIGINAL_REQUEST_URL_ATTR` attribute.
The filter also looks in the `ServerWebExchangeUtils.GATEWAY_SCHEME_PREFIX_ATTR` attribute to see if it equals `lb`.
If so, the same rules apply.
The following listing configures a `ReactiveLoadBalancerClientFilter`:

.application.yml
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
      - id: myRoute
        uri: lb://service
        predicates:
        - Path=/service/**
----

NOTE: By default, when a service instance cannot be found by the `ReactorLoadBalancer`, a `503` is returned.
You can configure the gateway to return a `404` by setting `spring.cloud.gateway.loadbalancer.use404=true`.

NOTE: The `isSecure` value of the `ServiceInstance` returned from the `ReactiveLoadBalancerClientFilter` overrides
the scheme specified in the request made to the Gateway.
For example, if the request comes into the Gateway over `HTTPS` but the `ServiceInstance` indicates it is not secure, the downstream request is made over `HTTP`.
The opposite situation can also apply.
However, if `GATEWAY_SCHEME_PREFIX_ATTR` is specified for the route in the Gateway configuration, the prefix is stripped and the resulting scheme from the route URL overrides the `ServiceInstance` configuration.

TIP: Gateway supports all the LoadBalancer features. You can read more about them in the https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-commons/docs/current/reference/html/#spring-cloud-loadbalancer[Spring Cloud Commons documentation].

[[routetorequesturl-filter]]
== `RouteToRequestUrl` Filter

If there is a `Route` object in the `ServerWebExchangeUtils.GATEWAY_ROUTE_ATTR` exchange attribute, the `RouteToRequestUrlFilter` runs.
It creates a new URI, based off of the request URI but updated with the URI attribute of the `Route` object.
The new URI is placed in the `ServerWebExchangeUtils.GATEWAY_REQUEST_URL_ATTR` exchange attribute.

If the URI has a scheme prefix, such as `lb:ws://serviceid`, the `lb` scheme is stripped from the URI and placed in the `ServerWebExchangeUtils.GATEWAY_SCHEME_PREFIX_ATTR` for use later in the filter chain.

[[websocket-routing-filter]]
== The Websocket Routing Filter

If the URL located in the `ServerWebExchangeUtils.GATEWAY_REQUEST_URL_ATTR` exchange attribute has a `ws` or `wss` scheme, the websocket routing filter runs. It uses the Spring WebSocket infrastructure to forward the websocket request downstream.

You can load-balance websockets by prefixing the URI with `lb`, such as `lb:ws://serviceid`.

NOTE: If you use https://github.com/sockjs[SockJS] as a fallback over normal HTTP, you should configure a normal HTTP route as well as the websocket Route.

The following listing configures a websocket routing filter:

.application.yml
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
      # SockJS route
      - id: websocket_sockjs_route
        uri: http://localhost:3001
        predicates:
        - Path=/websocket/info/**
      # Normal Websocket route
      - id: websocket_route
        uri: ws://localhost:3001
        predicates:
        - Path=/websocket/**
----

[[marking-an-exchange-as-routed]]
== Marking An Exchange As Routed

After the gateway has routed a `ServerWebExchange`, it marks that exchange as "`routed`" by adding `gatewayAlreadyRouted`
to the exchange attributes. Once a request has been marked as routed, other routing filters will not route the request again,
essentially skipping the filter. There are convenience methods that you can use to mark an exchange as routed
or check if an exchange has already been routed.

* `ServerWebExchangeUtils.isAlreadyRouted` takes a `ServerWebExchange` object and checks if it has been "`routed`".
* `ServerWebExchangeUtils.setAlreadyRouted` takes a `ServerWebExchange` object and marks it as "`routed`".
