= Sharing Routes between multiple Gateway instances

Spring Cloud Gateway offers two `RouteDefinitionRepository` implementations. The first one is the
`InMemoryRouteDefinitionRepository` which only lives within the memory of one Gateway instance.
This type of Repository is not suited to populate Routes across multiple Gateway instances.

In order to share Routes across a cluster of Spring Cloud Gateway instances, `RedisRouteDefinitionRepository` can be used.
To enable this kind of repository, the following property has to set to true: `spring.cloud.gateway.redis-route-definition-repository.enabled`
Likewise to the RedisRateLimiter Filter Factory it requires the use of the spring-boot-starter-data-redis-reactive Spring Boot starter.
