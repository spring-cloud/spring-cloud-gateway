[[httpheadersfilters]]
= HttpHeadersFilters

`HttpHeadersFilters` are applied to the requests before sending them downstream, such as in the `NettyRoutingFilter`.

[[forwarded-headers-filter]]
== Forwarded Headers Filter
The `Forwarded` Headers Filter creates a `Forwarded` header to send to the downstream service. It adds the `Host` header, scheme and port of the current request to any existing `Forwarded` header.

[[removehopbyhop-headers-filter]]
== RemoveHopByHop Headers Filter
The `RemoveHopByHop` Headers Filter removes headers from forwarded requests. The default list of headers that is removed comes from the https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging-14#section-7.1.3[IETF].

.The default removed headers are:
*  Connection
*  Keep-Alive
*  Proxy-Authenticate
*  Proxy-Authorization
*  TE
*  Trailer
*  Transfer-Encoding
*  Upgrade

To change this, set the `spring.cloud.gateway.filter.remove-hop-by-hop.headers` property to the list of header names to remove.

[[xforwarded-headers-filter]]
== XForwarded Headers Filter
The `XForwarded` Headers Filter creates various `X-Forwarded-*` headers to send to the downstream service. It uses the `Host` header, scheme, port and path of the current request to create the various headers.

Creating of individual headers can be controlled by the following boolean properties (defaults to true):

- `spring.cloud.gateway.x-forwarded.for-enabled`
- `spring.cloud.gateway.x-forwarded.host-enabled`
- `spring.cloud.gateway.x-forwarded.port-enabled`
- `spring.cloud.gateway.x-forwarded.proto-enabled`
- `spring.cloud.gateway.x-forwarded.prefix-enabled`

Appending multiple headers can be controlled by the following boolean properties (defaults to true):

- `spring.cloud.gateway.x-forwarded.for-append`
- `spring.cloud.gateway.x-forwarded.host-append`
- `spring.cloud.gateway.x-forwarded.port-append`
- `spring.cloud.gateway.x-forwarded.proto-append`
- `spring.cloud.gateway.x-forwarded.prefix-append`
