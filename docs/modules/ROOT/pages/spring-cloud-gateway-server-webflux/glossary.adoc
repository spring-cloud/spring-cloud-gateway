* *Route*: The basic building block of the gateway.
It is defined by an ID, a destination URI, a collection of predicates, and a collection of filters. A route is matched if the aggregate predicate is true.
* *Predicate*: This is a https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Predicate.html[Java 8 Function Predicate]. The input type is a https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/server/ServerWebExchange.html[Spring Framework `ServerWebExchange`].
This lets you match on anything from the HTTP request, such as headers or parameters.
* *Filter*: These are instances of https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-gateway/blob/main/spring-cloud-gateway-server/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/gateway/filter/GatewayFilter.java[`GatewayFilter`] that have been constructed with a specific factory.
Here, you can modify requests and responses before or after sending the downstream request.
