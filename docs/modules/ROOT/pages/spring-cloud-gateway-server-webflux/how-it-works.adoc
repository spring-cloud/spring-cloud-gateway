The following diagram provides a high-level overview of how Spring Cloud Gateway works:

image::spring_cloud_gateway_diagram.png[Spring Cloud Gateway Diagram]

Clients make requests to Spring Cloud Gateway. If the Gateway Handler Mapping determines that a request matches a route, it is sent to the Gateway Web Handler.
This handler runs the request through a filter chain that is specific to the request.
The reason the filters are divided by the dotted line is that filters can run logic both before and after the proxy request is sent.
All "`pre`" filter logic is executed. Then the proxy request is made. After the proxy request is made, the "`post`" filter logic is run.

NOTE: URIs defined in routes without a port get default port values of 80 and 443 for the HTTP and HTTPS URIs, respectively.

WARNING: Any path defined on a route URI will be ignored.
