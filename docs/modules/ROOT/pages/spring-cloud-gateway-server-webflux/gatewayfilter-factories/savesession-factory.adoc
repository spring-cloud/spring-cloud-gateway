= `SaveSession` `GatewayFilter` Factory

The `SaveSession` `GatewayFilter` factory forces a `WebSession::save` operation _before_ forwarding the call downstream.
This is of particular use when using something like https://projects.spring.io/spring-session/[Spring Session] with a lazy data store, and you need to ensure the session state has been saved before making the forwarded call.
The following example configures a `SaveSession` `GatewayFilter`:

.application.yml
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
      - id: save_session
        uri: https://example.org
        predicates:
        - Path=/foo/**
        filters:
        - SaveSession
----

If you integrate https://projects.spring.io/spring-security/[Spring Security] with Spring Session and want to ensure security details have been forwarded to the remote process, this is critical.
