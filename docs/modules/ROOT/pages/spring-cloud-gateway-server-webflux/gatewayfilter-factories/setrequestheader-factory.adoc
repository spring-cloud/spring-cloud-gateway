= `SetRequestHeader` `GatewayFilter` Factory

The `SetRequestHeader` `GatewayFilter` factory takes `name` and `value` parameters.
The following listing configures a `SetRequestHeader` `GatewayFilter`:

.application.yml
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
      - id: setrequestheader_route
        uri: https://example.org
        filters:
        - SetRequestHeader=X-Request-Red, Blue
----

This `GatewayFilter` replaces (rather than adding) all headers with the given name.
So, if the downstream server responded with `X-Request-Red:1234`, it will be replaced with `X-Request-Red:Blue`, which is what the downstream service would receive.

`SetRequestHeader` is aware of URI variables used to match a path or host.
URI variables may be used in the value and are expanded at runtime.
The following example configures an `SetRequestHeader` `GatewayFilter` that uses a variable:

.application.yml
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
      - id: setrequestheader_route
        uri: https://example.org
        predicates:
        - Host: {segment}.myhost.org
        filters:
        - SetRequestHeader=foo, bar-{segment}
