= `SetRequestUri` `GatewayFilter` Factory

The `SetRequestUri` `GatewayFilter` factory takes a `uri` parameter.
It offers a simple way to manipulate the request uri by allowing templated segments of the path.
This uses the URI templates from Spring Framework.
Multiple matching segments are allowed.
The following listing configures a `SetRequestUri` `GatewayFilter`:

.application.yml
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
      - id: seturi_route
        uri: no://op
        predicates:
        - Path=/{appId}/**
        filters:
        - SetRequestUri=http://{appId}.example.com
----

For a request path of `/red-application/blue`, this sets the uri to `http://red-application.example.com` before making the downstream request and the final url, including path is going to be `http://red-application.example.com/red-application/blue`
