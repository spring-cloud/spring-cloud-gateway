= RateLimiter Filter

The RateLimiter Filter use https://bucket4j.com/[Bucket4j] to determine if the current request is allowed to proceed. If it is not, a status of `HTTP 429 - Too Many Requests` (by default) is returned.

Please review https://bucket4j.com/8.7.0/toc.html#concepts[Bucket4j Concepts] prior to reading this documentation.

The algorithm used by Bucket4j is the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket[Token Bucket Algorithm].

The filter takes a `keyResolver` parameter and other Bucket4j configuration parameters. The key resolver is a `java.util.Function<ServerRequest, String>`. This allows the user to extract any information out of the request to use as a key in the configured https://github.com/bucket4j/bucket4j#bucket4j-distributed-features[Bucket4j distribution] mechanism. A common key would be the `Principal` retrieved from the `ServerRequest`.

By default, if the key resolver does not find a key, requests are denied with the `FORBIDDEN` status.

NOTE: Currently, the only way to configure key resolvers is through the Java DSL and not through external properties.

== Bucket4j Distributed Configuration

A bean of type `io.github.bucket4j.distributed.proxy.AsyncProxyManager`. To do this, use the `ProxyManager.asAsync()` method.

.RateLimiterConfiguration.java
[source,java]
----
import com.github.benmanes.caffeine.cache.Caffeine;
import io.github.bucket4j.caffeine.CaffeineProxyManager;

@Configuration
class RateLimiterConfiguration {

	@Bean
	public AsyncProxyManager<String> caffeineProxyManager() {
		Caffeine<String, RemoteBucketState> builder = (Caffeine) Caffeine.newBuilder().maximumSize(100);
		return new CaffeineProxyManager<>(builder, Duration.ofMinutes(1)).asAsync();
	}
}
----

The above configures an `AsyncProxyManager` using `Caffeine`, a local in-memory cache, useful for testing.

== Configuring Buckets

By default, the Bucket is configured using a configured `capacity` and `period`. Capacity is how many tokens the bucket has. The period is a `java.util.Duration` that defines how long for the tokens available in the bucket to be regenerated.

Other configuration items are the `statusCode` returned when the request is denied. By default it is 429, TO_MANY_REQUESTS. The `tokens` item defines how many tokens are used for each request and defaults to 1. The `headerName` item is the name of the header that contains the number of remaining tokens, this defaults to `X-RateLimit-Remaining`. The `timeout` option defines a `Duration` for the distributed bucket to return an answer and is not set by default.

The following is an example of configuring a route with rate limiting:

.RouteConfiguration.java
[source,java]
----
import static org.springframework.cloud.gateway.server.mvc.filter.Bucket4jFilterFunctions.rateLimit;
import static org.springframework.cloud.gateway.server.mvc.handler.GatewayRouterFunctions.route;
import static org.springframework.cloud.gateway.server.mvc.handler.HandlerFunctions.http;

@Configuration
class RouteConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public RouterFunction<ServerResponse> gatewayRouterFunctionsRateLimited() {
		return route("rate_limited_route")
			.GET("/api/**", http("https://example.org"))
				.filter(rateLimit(c -> c.setCapacity(100)
					.setPeriod(Duration.ofMinutes(1))
					.setKeyResolver(request -> request.servletRequest().getUserPrincipal().getName())))
				.build();
    }
}
----

This configures the rate limiting with a bucket capacity of 100 tokens per minute. The key resolver gets the principle name from the Servlet request.
