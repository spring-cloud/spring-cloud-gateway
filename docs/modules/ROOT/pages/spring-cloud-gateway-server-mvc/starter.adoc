= How to Include Spring Cloud Gateway Server MVC
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

To include Spring Cloud Gateway Server MVC in your project, use the starter with a group ID of `org.springframework.cloud` and an artifact ID of `spring-cloud-starter-gateway-mvc`.
See the https://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/[Spring Cloud Project page] for details on setting up your build system with the current Spring Cloud Release Train.

If you include the starter, but you do not want the gateway to be enabled, set `spring.cloud.gateway.mvc.enabled=false`.

IMPORTANT: Spring Cloud Gateway Server MVC is built on https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot#learn[Spring Boot] and https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc-functional.html[Spring WebMvc.fn].
As a consequence, many of the asynchronous or reactive libraries may not apply when you use Spring Cloud Gateway Server MVC.

IMPORTANT: Spring Cloud Gateway Server MVC works with traditional Servlet runtimes such as Tomcat and Jetty.
